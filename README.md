  ## Description
  When this application is deployed there is a note taker that allows people to write, save and delete notes. To allow the user to be more organised with their notes, there is a option to put a title for that specific note. The project has a ‘landing’ page to begin with, that has a link to connect the user to the note taker homepage where the user can be presented with previously saved notes, the option to write another note and a option to delete previous notes. Once the user as saved a note, the user will then be presented with another empty field.
